//the intution
The provided code is a recursive implementation of sorting a stack in ascending order using the concept of recursion and a helper function called sortedInsert.

Let's break down the logic step by step:

The sortedInsert function takes a stack (s) and a number (num) as input. It aims to insert num at the correct position in the sorted stack.

The function first checks two conditions:

If the stack is empty, it directly pushes num onto the stack since it will be the only element.
If the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack (s.top()) is less than num, it also pushes num onto the stack. This ensures that the elements in the stack remain sorted in ascending order.
If the above conditions are not met, it means that num should be inserted at the correct position within the existing sorted elements in the stack. To do this, the function performs the following steps:

Stores the top element of the stack in a variable called x.
Pops the top element from the stack.
Recursively calls sortedInsert on the remaining stack (s) and num.
After the recursive call, pushes x back onto the stack. This step is crucial as it ensures that the sorted order is maintained when elements are being inserted recursively.
The sortStack function is the main driver function that uses the sortedInsert function to sort the given stack.

Initially, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there is nothing to sort, so the function simply returns.

If the stack is not empty, the function performs the following steps:

Stores the top element of the stack in a variable called n.
Pops the top element from the stack.
Recursively calls sortStack on the remaining stack.
After the recursive call, calls the sortedInsert function to insert n at the correct position within the sorted stack.
By recursively calling sortStack and sortedInsert functions, the algorithm effectively sorts the given stack in ascending order. The recursion terminates when the stack is empty, and the sorted stack is obtained by inserting elements at their correct positions.
  
  //code
  #include <bits/stdc++.h> 

void sortedInsert(stack<int> &s, int num){
	if(s.empty() || (!s.empty() && s.top()<num)){
		s.push(num);
		return;
	}
	int x=s.top();
	s.pop();
	sortedInsert(s,num);
	s.push(x);
}

void sortStack(stack<int> &stack)
{
	// Write your code here
	if(stack.empty()){
		return;
	}
	int n=stack.top();
	stack.pop();

	sortStack(stack);
	sortedInsert(stack,n);
}
